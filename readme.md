# Prosper Loan Data Exploration

## Dataset

Prosper or Prosper Marketplace Inc. is America’s first marketplace lending platform, with over $10 billion in funded loans. It is a San Francisco, California based company specializing in loans at low interest rates to the borrowers. In this dataset, we are using the data from the Posper,which contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others. 

This project is divided into exploratory data analysis which contains univariate Plots, bivariate Plots, and multivariate Plots, as well as explanatory analysis explaining my main findings through the analysis of this dataset.


## Summary of Findings

1. The main question I want to answer based on the dataset analysis is what factors affect a loan’s outcome status? 

To simplify this question, I analysed the possible factors to affect the defaulted rate of the loan. In the exploration, I found that there were strong relationships between the defaulted rate and the factors including income range of the borrowers, employment status duration of the borrowers, debt to income ratio, bank card use, credit grade, prosper rating, delinquencies in last 7 years and borrowerAPR.

2. In addition to a loan’s outcome status, I also want to know the factors of the borrower’s APR.

Borrower’s APR is highly related to the loan outcome, and it increases as the risk increases, for example, when the credit grade decreases and the debit-income-ratio increases.

3. I also want to know whether original loan amount will affect the outcome of loan.

Based on the data, there is no obvious relationship between the loan amount and the outcome.


## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I mainlu focus on the affects of the defaulted rate of the loans, and also one plot showing the relationship between borrowerAPR and debit-to-income ratio as well as the prosper rating, followed by the insights from the data and my thoughts.
